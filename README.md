# Adv-Mechatronics-Wildfire-Robot

This repository contains project files for the 'Wildland Firefighting Robot'. This was the term project for the [Advanced Mechatronics](http://engineering.nyu.edu/mechatronics/vkapila/) course taught at New York University by [Prof. Vikram Kapila](https://engineering.nyu.edu/faculty/vikram-kapila). There are three projects in the repository, each one implementing different functionality for the robot: first serving as a remote controlled all-terrain bot, second for the manipulator part mounted on top of the ATV and third one is final integration to access and control the robot over the internet from anywhere in the world using a [MIT-Inventor](https://appinventor.mit.edu/) mobile app and [Google Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/).
